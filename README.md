# PIC18F4550-Microchip-Proyects-
> These are some proyect implementations with the PIC18F4550 Microchip microcontroller  


All the proyects where programed on ``MPLAB X IDE``, tested and simulated on ``Proteus`` and implemented in the CUCEI's electric laboratory.  
The documentation of each proyect could be founded in the PDFs of each folder.
